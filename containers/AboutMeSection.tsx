               <p>
                  I've been passionate about software development since I was in high school and
                  found an outlet of that passion in game development. I went to school for game
                  development and after working in the games industry became captivated by the
                  creativity and challenge of web development.

                  I've found a new sense of enjoyment from this different medium. A new canvas for
                  my passion for problem solving. In my spare time I find myself tinkering around
                  with side projects, searching for a more streamlined development process, and
                  finding that perfect stack. ðŸ¥ž
               </p>
               <p>
                  Besides web and games I enjoy climbing mountains, doing yoga, tinkering with tech,
                  camping, and travelling with my wife.
