        At The Loneliness Project, we believe that stories have powerâ€”the power
        to heal both listener and teller, and to show us that we aren't ever
        truly alone. Stories are powerful tools for building empathy and growing
        kindness. Those shared on the site are deeply personal yet profoundly
        universal.

        Marissa expressed her wish to move the site off of its exiting hosting
        to have more control over its development and its future. The original
        site was built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but access to
        the source code was limited, so I took on the task of rebuilding the
        site from the ground up using modern technologies, as well as making
        several quality of life improvements to the experience.
