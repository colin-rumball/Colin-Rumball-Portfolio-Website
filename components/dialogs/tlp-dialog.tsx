            The Loneliness Project is a passion project started by my dear
            friend Marissa Korda. It began small and found fast success
            receiving press coverage and thousands of stories.

            At The Loneliness Project, we believe that stories have powerâ€”the
            power to heal both listener and teller, and to show us that we
            aren't ever truly alone. Stories are powerful tools for building
            empathy and growing kindness. Those shared on the site are deeply
            personal yet profoundly universal.

        Marissa expressed her wish to move the site off of its exiting hosting
        to have more control over its development and its future. The original
        site was built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but access to
        the source code was limited, so I took on the task of rebuilding the
        site from the ground up using modern technologies, as well as making
        several quality of life improvements to the experience.
